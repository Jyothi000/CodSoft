This is how I designed my MAgicMinds toy store app;

>>Gather Inspiration: Explore existing designs for ideas. Check resources like the Toy Store Landing Page Design and eCommerce UI Kit on Figma Community.
>>Create Wireframes: Start with low-fidelity wireframes to outline the app structure, focusing on layout and navigation.
>>Design High-Fidelity Mockups: Develop high-fidelity designs by adding colors, typography, and images. Use Figma's design tools to refine elements.
>>Prototype: Build an interactive prototype to simulate user interactions and flows.
>>User Testing: Share the prototype for feedback, making iterative improvements based on user insights.
>>Finalize Design: Polish the design, ensuring all elements are aligned and functional before handoff.
